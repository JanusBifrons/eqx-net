# Lessons Learned — EQX Peri

Chronological log of non-obvious findings discovered while implementing the phased plan. Append-only; each entry dated, referencing phase and commit.

Use this file for findings that would cost a future Claude (or human) time to re-derive: gotchas, benchmark surprises, failure modes the blueprint didn't anticipate. Do **not** use this file for general architecture — that belongs in CLAUDE.md.

Entry format:

## 2026-04-18 — Phase 0 — Foundation seeded
Commit: initial scaffolding.

Phase 1 is expected to surface the first real gameplay findings (Rapier WASM async init timing, Colyseus schema types under strict TS, pixi-viewport v8 with React's mount lifecycle).

## 2026-04-18 — Phase 0 — better-sqlite3 not installed at Phase 0
Commit: initial scaffolding.

`better-sqlite3` 11.x has no prebuilt binaries for Node 24, and `node-gyp` requires Python to build from source, which this Windows dev machine lacks. Rather than introduce a Python dependency or downgrade Node, we deferred installing `better-sqlite3` until Phase 7 (when it is actually used). The Technology Stack Matrix in the root CLAUDE.md still lists it as the server zone's persistence layer — only the `package.json` dependency was removed.

**Action at Phase 7**: evaluate whether to pin to `better-sqlite3@^12` (which ships Node 24 prebuilts), downgrade the project's Node engine, or switch to another SQLite binding. Decide at that boundary, not now.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 1 — Thrust/turn direction mismatch between Rapier and Pixi
Commit: Phase 1 physics fix.

The ship polygon draws the nose at (0, -16) in Pixi local space — pointing visual-up at sprite.rotation=0. Rapier's angle=0 means facing +X (right). The original thrust formula `(cos θ, sin θ)` applied force in the wrong direction relative to the visual ship facing.

**Correct thrust formula**: `(-sin θ, cos θ)`. Derived from the visual nose direction in Rapier world space: at θ=0, the nose is Pixi-up = Rapier +Y = (0, 1) = (-sin 0, cos 0). ✓

**Turning was also inverted**: `sprite.rotation = -ship.angle`, so Rapier CCW (positive ω) produces a decreasing sprite.rotation = CCW on screen = visual left turn. The original code had A → negative ω (CW in Rapier → CW on screen → right turn). Swapped to A → positive ω, D → negative ω.

**Rule**: whenever the renderer applies a Y-flip (`sprite.y = -rapier.y`) and a rotation-flip (`sprite.rotation = -rapier.angle`), the "visual forward" direction is `(-sin θ, cos θ)` not `(cos θ, sin θ)`. Don't change the polygon — fix the impulse formula.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 1 — Vite WebSocket proxy for Colyseus rooms
Commit: Phase 1 WS proxy fix.

After fixing HTTP matchmaking CORS via `/matchmake` Vite proxy, the Colyseus room WebSocket still hung. Root cause: `colyseus.js` constructs the room WebSocket URL as `ws://localhost:5173/<processId>/<roomId>?sessionId=xxx` (from the base `Client` URL). Vite's built-in proxy `bypass()` function is also called for WebSocket upgrade requests (contrary to what the docs imply), so a `'/'` rule with `bypass(req) { return req.url; }` caused both HTTP and WS to be served by Vite — the WebSocket hung waiting for a 101 that never came.

**Fix**: remove all `ws:true` proxy rules; add a `configureServer` plugin that listens for `httpServer.upgrade` events and manually TCP-proxies non-HMR WebSocket connections to port 2567 using `node:net`. HMR moved to a dedicated port (`server.hmr.port: 24678`) so it never hits the same upgrade listener.

**Diagnostic that unlocked it**: adding `httpServer.on('upgrade', ...)` to the Colyseus server to log every WebSocket upgrade. Absence of that log meant the upgrade was never reaching the server.

## 2026-04-18 — Phase 1 — @colyseus/schema v3 + tsx decorator mismatch
Commit: Phase 1 runtime fix.

Three separate decorator-related crashes appeared together:

1. **`defineTypes()` + `Symbol.metadata` crash** (`EncodeOperation.ts:37`): @colyseus/schema v3's encoder reads `constructor[Symbol.metadata]` to locate field type descriptors. `defineTypes()` registers types in a parallel registry but never populates `Symbol.metadata`. Result: every `broadcastPatch` tick throws.

2. **`@type` decorator + Stage 3 transform** (`target.constructor is undefined`): switching to `@type` decorators failed because `tsx watch src/server/index.ts` had no tsconfig to read, so esbuild defaulted to Stage 3 decorator semantics. @colyseus/schema's `@type` implementation is written for the legacy `experimentalDecorators` API where the decorator receives `(target: prototype, key: string)`. Under Stage 3, it receives `(value, context)` — `target` is `undefined`.

3. **tsx `watch` flag ordering**: `tsx --tsconfig ... watch ...` treats `watch` as the script to run. Correct order is `tsx watch --tsconfig ... <script>`.

**Resolution**: `tsconfig.server.json` gets `experimentalDecorators: true, useDefineForClassFields: false`. `useDefineForClassFields: false` is required because `target: ES2022` would otherwise default it to `true`, causing field initializers to run via `Object.defineProperty` *after* decorators and overwrite their registrations. The `dev:server` script passes `--tsconfig tsconfig.server.json` after `watch` so tsx/esbuild reads the right settings.

**Downstream phases**: any server-side schema class must use `@type` decorators (not `defineTypes()`). The tsconfig settings apply to the entire server zone.

## 2026-04-18 — Phase 0 — ESLint `no-undef` disabled globally
Commit: initial scaffolding.

TypeScript already checks for undefined identifiers with full type information, including `process`, `__dirname`, `document`, etc. under the right `lib`/`types` settings. ESLint's `no-undef` was double-checking the same thing and fighting against Node-context config files (`vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`). Disabled project-wide; TS is the authority. If a genuine "undefined identifier" slips through, `tsc -b` will catch it.
