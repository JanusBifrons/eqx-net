# E2E framework — tier taxonomy + per-spec triage

**Status:** Phase 0b of the e2e-rebuild plan (`C:\Users\alecv\.claude\plans\i-want-you-to-lively-tulip.md`). Phase 2 acts on this doc — tagging specs into Playwright projects, moving `@diag` specs out of CI, replacing `waitForTimeout` settles with state predicates, raising the suite timeout.

## Why this doc exists

On 2026-05-19 a 6-commit wrap-up shipped with the full deterministic suite green (typecheck 0 / lint 0 / 1031 unit / integration / boot / bench) and was unplayable on-device. Phase 1 of the e2e-rebuild plan built the netcode-health gate (`pnpm e2e:netgate`) to answer the playability question the deterministic suite was never trying to answer; this doc Phase-0b — the prerequisite for Phase 2's framework restructure — classifies every existing E2E spec so the runner can ship a coherent four-tier story instead of one unsorted bag of `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`.

The cost of the current bag-of-specs setup is concrete: every E2E run shoulders the full ~50-spec wall-clock, every `pnpm e2e` includes 6 specs that explicitly assert nothing (capture-only `*-probe`/`*-capture`/`*-diagnostic` specs), 29 of those specs trip lint with "unused eslint-disable" comments that mask real warnings, and CI's `timeout-minutes: 15` is at the same wall-clock as the suite ceiling — a single slow spec on a CI runner can abort the lot.

## The four tiers

| Tier | What it is | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `@smoke` | Fast deterministic critical-path locks. The "did the app start, can a player join, do core flows work" floor. Smoke is what fails *first* in CI so a regression surfaces in ≤2 min. | `pnpm e2e:smoke` (subset of `pnpm e2e`, runs first). CI step 1. |
| `@feature` | Per-surface exhaustive locks. Wider coverage, slower per spec, often 30 s edge cases. Where most of the suite lives. | `pnpm e2e` (runs `@smoke` first, then `@feature`). CI step 2. |
| `@gate` | Machine-insensitive engineered gates that compare HEAD vs a baseline ref on the same box in the same session. Currently: the netcode-health gate (Phase 1). | `pnpm e2e:netgate` (the driver — `pnpm e2e:gate` runs the spec standalone, which skips without the driver's env). Required for live-loop-touching changes; not in default CI yet (Phase 5 wires it). |
| `@diag` | Dev-capture artefacts that assert nothing meaningful — they collect CDP traces, frame markers, DOM dumps, etc. for offline analysis. Useful for the developer who's actively investigating. Useless as a regression signal because they don't fail when the surface regresses. | Manual only. Moved to `tests/diag/`; excluded from default Playwright `testDir`. Never in CI. |

### Tier criteria (what gets the tag)

**`@smoke`** if all of:
- single concern, ≤ ~3 tests per file
- deterministic environment (`?room=test-sector` engineering rooms, scripted inputs, state predicates not `waitForTimeout`)
- ≤ 30 s wall-clock (the global default cap; smoke MUST stay under it without the per-test `setTimeout` extension)
- covers a critical-path failure mode (boot, join, spawn, basic combat, ship switch, persistence read-after-write, mobile input, the worker-boundary probe-page locks)

**`@feature`** otherwise, if the spec ASSERTS specific behaviour (not just captures data) and locks a surface that could regress in isolation. Includes the multi-test surface specs (combat, robustness, weapon-switching), the integration smokes that need extended timeouts (`feel-test-lockstep`/`feel-tuning`, `swarm-tidi`, `tidi-overlay`, `swarm-bandwidth`), and the per-surface UI/wire locks.

**`@gate`** if the spec is meaningless without a baseline comparison — it does not run usefully standalone, only via a driver that supplies the baseline arm. Currently exactly one spec (`netcode-health.spec.ts`) which `skip`s itself when `NETGATE_ARMS` is unset.

**`@diag`** if the spec's own docstring or test title says "capture", "probe", "diagnostic", or "data only, not a regression lock" — i.e. it's instrumentation, not assertion. These are kept (often invaluable for debugging) but moved to `tests/diag/` and excluded from CI so they don't bloat the suite wall-clock.

## Verdicts roll-up

| Bucket | Count | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| `@smoke` | 14 | KEEP all. Default CI step 1; smoke-first fail-fast. |
| `@feature` | 30 | KEEP all. Default CI step 2. Two specs (`combat`, `robustness`) carry most of the `waitForTimeout` debt — Phase 2c target. Two drawer-* specs flagged for *consolidation* (one combined `@feature` covering open/close + roster-card flow), but consolidation is its own commit, not part of the tagging commit. |
| `@gate` | 1 | KEEP. Driven by `pnpm e2e:netgate`; standalone `pnpm e2e:gate` runs a skipped no-op (expected). |
| `@diag` | 6 | MOVE to `tests/diag/`, exclude from `testDir`. Manually runnable for investigations; never in CI. |
| Total | 51 | |

## Phase 2 acts on this doc — implementation order

1. **`refactor(e2e): tag specs into smoke/feature/gate tiers (plan: e2e-rebuild)`**
   - Edit `playwright.config.ts`: add `projects` array with `smoke` / `feature` / `gate` entries using `testMatch` lists drawn from the table above. Zero in-spec edits — the tier lives in the config.
   - Add `pnpm e2e:smoke` / `pnpm e2e:gate` scripts; rewrite `pnpm e2e` to `playwright test --project=smoke --project=feature` (gate is invoked separately).
   - Sanity: `pnpm e2e:smoke` runs the 14 listed specs and nothing else; `pnpm e2e` runs 14+30; `pnpm e2e:gate` runs only `netcode-health.spec.ts` (which skips).

2. **`chore(e2e): move diagnostic captures to tests/diag, drop from CI (plan: e2e-rebuild)`**
   - `git mv` the 6 `@diag` specs into `tests/diag/`.
   - Either update `playwright.config.ts:testDir` to remain `'./tests/e2e'` (already correct — the move alone drops them) OR add explicit `testIgnore: ['**/tests/diag/**']` for clarity.
   - Update the 6 specs' module docstrings to mention they're manually runnable from `tests/diag/`.
   - Cleans up the 29 "unused eslint-disable" lint warnings concentrated in those files.

3. **`refactor(e2e): state predicates over fixed waits (plan: e2e-rebuild)`**
   - Replace `waitForTimeout` settles with `waitForFunction` predicates across the kept `@smoke` and `@feature` specs. Skip intentional pacing (rare — almost always there is a better predicate).
   - Scope-bound: the 196 `waitForTimeout` occurrences live across 36 files; the cleanup is per-spec, test-first (each affected test must still pass after the rewrite).
   - The highest-debt files are `combat.spec.ts` (36) and `robustness.spec.ts` (27) — those alone are 32% of the total. Smaller batches commit per-spec or per-group.

4. **`chore(ci): raise globalTimeout + suite cap, add bench:check (plan: e2e-rebuild)`**
   - `playwright.config.ts:36`: `globalTimeout` 6 min → ~25 min (hostile M4 — 6 min would abort the whole suite first on a slow runner).
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `timeout-minutes: 15` → `25`; add `bench:check` step (`pnpm run bench` against committed `benchmarks/baseline.json` — already exists, just unwired from CI).
   - Optionally re-sequence the e2e steps in CI as `pnpm e2e:smoke` → `pnpm e2e` (smoke-first fail-fast). The default `pnpm e2e` already runs smoke first via project order, so this is mostly cosmetic CI clarity.
   - **DO NOT** add `pnpm e2e:netgate` to CI in this commit. The gate creates worktrees and is multi-minute; wiring it into CI is Phase 5 work after the gate's CI cost is measured and the worker count / lockfile sync model are settled.

## Open questions, deliberately deferred

- **Should `feel-test-lockstep` + `feel-tuning` be reaped?** Their per-frame canary role is now in `tests/unit/swarmInterpolation.smoothness.test.ts` (deterministic, ~1 s) and `netcode-health.spec.ts` (relative, machine-insensitive). They survive here as integration smokes that cross-validate the live server+client. If they ever flake on the CI runner, the answer is to reap them, not widen the bound — the load-bearing canary is elsewhere.
- **Should the consolidated drawer spec be written in Phase 2 or Phase 3?** Plan said "the 6 drawer-* collapse to one `@feature`" but only 2 of the drawer-* specs are real-flow locks (`drawer-galaxy-overview-spawn`, `drawer-galaxy-map-open-close`); the other 4 are `@diag` and get moved out. Consolidating those 2 is its own refactor — not part of the Phase 2 tagging commit.
- **Where do new tests file themselves?** New specs default to `@feature`. Promoting to `@smoke` requires (a) the spec stays under 30 s, (b) it locks a critical-path failure mode (boot/join/spawn/basic combat/ship switch/persistence/mobile/probe-page), (c) it uses state predicates not fixed waits. Demoting to `@diag` requires the spec to be capture-only — `@diag` is a quarantine for "useful for debugging, useless as a regression signal," and a spec that asserts behaviour should never be `@diag`.
