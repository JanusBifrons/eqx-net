/**
 * SquadPool — groups the hunter-bot pool into homogeneous squads of 8 with a
 * shared "strategic brain" (wave-system plan, Phase 3).
 *
 * The individual bots still live in `HunterBotPool` and still fly + pick
 * targets independently via the unchanged `HostileDroneBehaviour` (the "limbs").
 * The SQUAD is the strategic unit the `WaveDirector` commands: it warps as one,
 * goes hostile as one, and retreats as one. This layer owns ONLY the squad-level
 * record (membership + state machine + current/target sector + assigned
 * faction); per-bot lifecycle (active/in-transit/respawning) stays in
 * `HunterBotPool`, and squad member liveness is derived from it on demand.
 *
 * Squad-aware respawn (hostile-review C4): a bot that dies mid-wave respawns
 * back into ITS squad's sector (via `respawnSectorFor`), not the ambient
 * distribution — so "warp/fight together" survives individual deaths. A squad
 * tolerates `botIds.length < SQUAD_SIZE` (load-shed / partial arrival); the pool
 * refills members over time.
